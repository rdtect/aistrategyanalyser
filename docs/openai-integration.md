# OpenAI Response API Integration

This document outlines how to effectively integrate OpenAI's API into our aiStrategyBot architecture.

## API Overview

OpenAI's API provides several endpoints for generating AI responses, with the primary methods being:

1. **Completion API** - Generate text completions
2. **Chat Completions API** - Generate conversational responses
3. **Streaming API** - Receive responses incrementally in real-time

For our strategy analysis application, the Chat Completions API with streaming is most appropriate.

# Active Implementation Context

## Current Focus

- Implementing OpenAI Responses API integration
- Building the PWA features with proper logo and offline support
- Addressing code redundancies and architecture issues
- Finalizing the new analysis UI flow
- Fixing immediate issues (theme flash, missing icons, API errors)

## Implementation Strategy

1. ✓ Migrate client-side components to SvelteKit routes
2. ✓ Implement streaming responses
3. ✓ Create SVG logo and PWA support
4. ✓ Update to OpenAI Responses API
5. ✓ Fix theme-related issues and set dark mode as default
6. Next: Refactor API service code for consistency
7. Next: Complete database integration with Prisma
8. Next: Implement proper error handling

## Architecture Changes

- Changed from client-side component-based to SvelteKit route-based architecture
- `/chats/[id]` route displays individual chats with proper loading
- `/api/ai/stream` and `/api/ai/response` endpoints using OpenAI Responses API
- PWA support with service worker and offline capability
- Logo created with SVG and proper favicon implementation
- Default dark theme with flash prevention using inline script

## Current Issues Identified

- ✓ Theme flash issue (fixed by setting dark mode as default)
- ✓ Missing PWA icons (created placeholder files)
- ✓ OpenAI health check parameter error (fixed max_output_tokens)
- ✓ Error page imports issue (fixed $app/stores import)
- Redundant OpenAI client initializations across multiple files
- Inconsistent response handling for Responses API output
- Mixed mock and real data usage
- Duplicated prompt construction logic
- Insufficient type safety with overuse of `any` types
- Inconsistent error handling approaches

## Progress Tracking

- [x] Refactor chat interface to use SvelteKit routes
- [x] Implement streaming responses
- [x] Update to OpenAI Responses API
- [x] Create SVG logo and add PWA support
- [x] Fix theme flash and set dark mode as default
- [x] Fix various errors (API health check, error page)
- [ ] Centralize OpenAI service and standardize response handling
- [ ] Complete database integration with Prisma
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling

## Next Steps

1. Refactor OpenAI API integration into a centralized service
2. Standardize error handling across the application
3. Complete database integration with Prisma
4. Improve type safety and remove `any` types
5. Add proper testing framework

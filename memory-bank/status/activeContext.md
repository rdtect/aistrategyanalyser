# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on code organization, TypeScript error resolution, and standardizing error handling patterns across the application. We've implemented feature-based organization and fixed PWA TypeScript integration issues.

### Latest Feature-Based Organization Implementation (2025-03-26)

We've successfully implemented a feature-based organization structure:

1. **Created New Directory Structure**

   - Established `src/lib/features` for feature-specific code
   - Created `src/lib/core` for shared foundational code
   - Organized components, stores, and utilities within each feature
   - Moved chat components to `features/chat` directory
   - Placed shared components and utilities in `core` subdirectories

2. **Set Up Feature Modules**

   - Implemented chat feature as the first feature module
   - Prepared structure for analysis and settings features
   - Created proper barrel files for all modules
   - Updated imports to use the new structure

3. **Updated Imports Throughout the App**

   - Used new directory structure in `+layout.svelte`
   - Updated import paths to use barrel files
   - Maintained consistent import patterns across the codebase

4. **Prepared for Next Features**
   - Created placeholder directories for analysis and settings features
   - Set up feature-specific components and stores directories
   - Established patterns for future feature implementation

### Latest Code Organization Improvements (2025-03-25)

We've made significant improvements to the codebase organization and TypeScript integration:

1. **Fixed PWA TypeScript Issues**

   - Updated type declarations for virtual PWA modules
   - Fixed import issues in the layout component
   - Consolidated service worker registration logic to avoid duplication
   - Improved error handling in service worker setup

2. **Standardized Error Handling**

   - Created a comprehensive error handling utility
   - Implemented proper error types and standardized response format
   - Added an ErrorBoundary component for consistent error display
   - Improved type safety for error handling across the application

3. **Enhanced Code Organization**

   - Added barrel files for components, stores, and utilities
   - Streamlined imports across the application

   - Integrate ErrorBoundary component in all appropriate places
   - Update API calls to use the standardized error handling utilities
   - Refactor existing error handling code to use the new pattern

2. **Database Integration**

   - Complete the Prisma schema design
   - Set up database migrations
   - Connect API endpoints to database
   - Replace mock data with real database fetching

3. **Testing Framework Setup**
   - Select and set up a testing framework

   - Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated testing

### Latest Settings Enhancement (2025-03-21)

We've enhanced the settings functionality:

1. **Added Web Search Settings**

   - Added `webSearch` and `webSearchContextSize` properties to the chat settings
   - Created dedicated methods for updating each setting type
   - Implemented proper loading and saving of settings to localStorage
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in the settings page

2. **Improved Settings UI**

   - Updated the settings page to use direct event handlers instead of bindings
   - Added proper type safety for all settings values
   - Created a better separation of concerns with dedicated handler functions

3. **Enhanced Persistence**
   - Created a dedicated `saveSettingsToLocalStorage` function for better reuse
   - Improved loading of settings during initialization
   - Added type safety checks when loading data from localStorage

### Previous Store Integration Improvements (2025-03-21)

We've made significant improvements to the chat store implementation:

1. **Fixed Store Separation**

   - Created proper store file at `src/lib/stores/chatStore.svelte.ts`
   - Keep the chat store logic in a dedicated store module
   - This provides proper separation of concerns while maintaining Svelte 5 runes

2. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**

   - Added proper types to parameters in find methods
   - Fixed issues with the archived code by providing mock implementations
   - Fixed function signature of the methods to align with TypeScript requirements

3. **Improved Imports**

   - Updated Chat component to import from `$lib/stores/chatStore.svelte` instead of local file
   - Maintained proper state management with Svelte 5 runes

4. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Updated interface definitions with proper TypeScript method signatures
   - Improved comments and explanations
   - Streamlined the code organization

### Previous Chat Store Improvements (2025-03-21)

We've made significant improvements to the chat store implementation:

1. **Integrated Chat Store with Component**

   - Moved the chat store logic into `src/lib/components/chat/Chat.svelte.ts`
   - Created a self-contained module that can be imported directly by the Chat component
   - Eliminated the need for context providers by directly importing the store

2. **Improved State Management with Runes**

   - Used Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived.by) for all reactive state
   - Minimized the use of $effect to only where absolutely necessary
   - Implemented proper reactive derivations for computed values

3. **Fixed Multiple Initialization Issues**

   - Implemented a true singleton pattern for the chat store
   - Added a module-level instance variable to prevent creating multiple instances
   - Created a mergeChats function to handle data coming from different routes

4. **Enhanced Streaming Support**
   - Added proper streaming support in the chat API
   - Implemented message status tracking (streaming, sent, error)
   - Added visual indicators for message streaming state

### Fixed TypeScript Errors

1. **Fixed Archived Code TypeScript Errors**

   - Added mock implementation for openaiClient in archived code
   - Prevented TypeScript errors without modifying core functionality

2. **Fixed Category Question Prompts Structure**

   - Updated the JSON structure to match the expected interface
   - Simplified prompt format from complex object to simple string
   - Fixed type issues in the form component

3. **Fixed Accordion Component Issues**
   - Added required control property to Accordion.Item components
   - Fixed snippet names to match the component API

### Previous Data Flow Analysis (2025-03-20)

We've analyzed the data flow to understand why chats weren't displaying despite being loaded correctly:

1. **Centralized vs. Local State Management**
   - The application was using both centralized (chatStore) and local state management (allChats in +page.svelte)
   - This caused conflicts where the chats were loading but not rendering correctly
2. **Store Initialization and Synchronization**

   - Multiple components were trying to initialize the store (layout, chat page)
   - The layout was initializing with sample data
   - The chat page was trying to load and manage its own state

3. **Fixed Data Flow**
   - Removed local state management from the chat page
   - Used the centralized chatStore throughout the app
   - Added proper getter for the chats array
   - Tracked initialization state to prevent multiple initializations
   - Added debugging tools to expose chatStore to window.\_\_chatStore

### Previous Fixes (2025-03-20)

1. **Fixed Chat List Redirect Issue**

   - Removed redirect to home page from `/routes/chats/+page.svelte`
   - Implemented proper chat listing functionality
   - This allows users to view their chat history

2. **Fixed New Analysis Step Navigation**
   - Simplified the step navigation logic in `/routes/chats/new/+page.svelte`
   - Fixed issues with Next button remaining disabled
   - Added better form field UX with placeholders and instructions

### Underlying Issues Identified

We identified and fixed issues with the chat listing page not properly rendering chat history:

1. **Type Mismatches**

   - The sample chats didn't have a messages array, but the Chat type required it
   - Fixed by explicitly mapping sampleChats to add empty messages arrays

2. **Centralization Issues**

   - Components were accessing store data in different ways
   - Fixed by standardizing access through proper getters

3. **Reactivity Problems**
   - Updates to the chat store weren't triggering UI updates
   - Fixed by using $derived.by() and proper reactive accessors

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Server Integration**

   - Add proper OpenAI API integration
   - Implement authentication for API calls
   - Add persistent storage for chats

2. **Performance Optimization**

   - Test chat store under load with many messages
   - Optimize rendering of large chat histories
   - Add virtualization for very long conversations

3. **UX Improvements**
   - Implement better error handling and user feedback
   - Add loading indicators for network operations
   - Improve mobile responsiveness

- ✅ Added consistent, type-safe error boundary component

## Current Status

- Most TypeScript errors have been resolved
- Error handling has been standardized
- PWA functionality works correctly
- Improved overall code organization

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

1. **Database Integration**

   - Complete Prisma schema implementation
   - Create migration scripts
   - Connect API endpoints to database
   - Replace mock data with database fetching

2. **Standardized UI Error Handling Integration**

   - Integrate the new ErrorBoundary component throughout the app
   - Use the enhanced error handling utilities in all API calls
   - Add proper error feedback for users

3. **Testing Implementation**

   - Add unit tests for critical business logic
   - Add component tests for UI components
   - Set up e2e testing with Playwright

4. **Feature-Based Organization Completion**
   - Continue implementing feature-based organization
   - Move remaining components into appropriate feature folders
   - Update imports to use barrel files

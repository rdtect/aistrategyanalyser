## April 1st, 2024: Chat & Settings Refactoring Completion

- **Completed Chat Refactoring Plan:**
  - Unified OpenAI service (`openai.ts`) return types for consistency.
  - Enhanced type safety in `ChatService.ts` by adding data validation/hydration when loading from storage.
  - Successfully refactored `AnalysisCreation.svelte` into modular step components (`FrameworkStep`, `ContextStep`, `QuestionsStep`, `ReviewStep`).
  - Improved intent detection in `ChatLogic.svelte.ts` using keyword mapping instead of simple string includes.
  - Standardized error state handling in `ChatLogic.svelte.ts`.
  - Parallelized initial analysis questions in `ChatLogic.svelte.ts` using `Promise.allSettled`.
  - Removed unused `ErrorBoundary.svelte` component, relying on root `+error.svelte`.
- **Settings Page Refactoring:**
  - Created global settings store (`src/lib/stores/config.svelte.ts`) using Svelte 5 `$state`.
  - Refactored `settings/+page.svelte` to use the global store, removing local state and manual persistence logic.
  - Implemented Skeleton UI toast notifications using context API (`ToastProvider`, `getContext`).
- **API Endpoint Configuration:**
  - Modified `/api/v1/openai/+server.ts` to always use the Responses API (`handleResponsesAPI`) path.
  - Forced web search tool usage for initial analysis questions in `ChatLogic.svelte.ts`.
- **General Cleanup:**
  - Removed unused imports, CSS, state variables, and functions across multiple files (`+layout.svelte`, `AnalysisCreation.svelte`, step components, `ChatLogic.svelte.ts`).
  - Fixed various linter errors related to types, CSS, and Svelte 5 syntax (dynamic components, attributes).
  - Simplified `localStorage` usage in `ChatService.ts`.

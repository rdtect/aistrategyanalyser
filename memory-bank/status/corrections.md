## 2025-03-26 - Implemented Feature-Based Code Organization

### Issue

The codebase had an inconsistent directory structure with components, stores, and services spread across multiple directories without clear organization. This made it difficult to maintain and scale the application as new features are added.

### Fix

1. **Created Feature-Based Directory Structure**:

   - Established `src/lib/features` for feature-specific code
   - Created `src/lib/core` for shared foundational code
   - Organized components, stores, and utilities within each feature
   - Moved chat components to `features/chat` directory
   - Placed shared components and utilities in `core` subdirectories

2. **Reorganized Files**:

   - Moved chat components from `src/lib/components/chat` to `src/lib/features/chat/components`
   - Moved chat store from `src/lib/stores` to `src/lib/features/chat/stores`
   - Moved OpenAI service to `src/lib/core/api`
   - Moved error handling to `src/lib/core/utils`
   - Moved ErrorBoundary component to `src/lib/core/ui`
   - Moved PWA components to `src/lib/core/pwa`

3. **Created Barrel Files**:
   - Added index.ts files for each directory to simplify imports
   - Set up consistent export patterns across all modules
   - Updated imports in layout file to use new structure

### Pattern Rule

- Organize code by feature rather than by technical type
- Keep feature-specific components, stores, and utilities together
- Place shared, reusable code in a core directory
- Use barrel files for clean imports
- Follow consistent naming and organization patterns

## 2025-03-25 - Fixed PWA TypeScript Module Errors

### Issue

TypeScript errors were occurring in the layout file related to PWA virtual modules:

```
Cannot find module 'virtual:pwa-info' or its corresponding type declarations.
Cannot find module 'virtual:pwa-assets/head' or its corresponding type declarations.
Cannot find module 'virtual:pwa-register' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

### Fix

1. **Updated Type Declarations**:

   - Created proper TypeScript declarations for PWA virtual modules
   - Added interface for `pwaAssetsHead` export to match actual usage
   - Added proper typing for the `register` function

2. **Simplified Service Worker Registration**:

   - Consolidated service worker registration in `+layout.svelte`
   - Removed duplicate registration in external utility file
   - Added proper error handling for service worker registration
   - Made the registration code more maintainable with cleaner structure

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added try/catch block around service worker registration
   - Improved error reporting for registration failures
   - Added proper TypeScript types to callback functions

### Pattern Rule

- Create proper type declarations for all virtual modules used in the app
- Keep service worker registration logic in one place
- Use proper error handling for all async operations
- Consolidate related functionality to avoid duplication

## 2025-03-19 - Svelte 5 Runes State Variable Declarations

### Issue

Several files in the codebase used `const` with `$state()` rune, which causes errors when attempting to modify the state variables.

### Fix

- Changed declaration from `const` to `let` for mutable `$state()` variables:

  - `isStreaming` in `src/lib/services/openaiClient.ts`
  - `isLoading` in `src/routes/chats/[id]/ChatLogic.ts`
  - `availableQuestions` in `src/routes/analyses/[id]/questions/+page.svelte`

- Changed declaration from `let` to `const` for `$derived()` variables:
  - `categoryStats` in `src/lib/components/chat/NewAnalysisModal/Screen2Checklist.svelte`
  - `showCustomRegion` in `src/routes/analyses/new/+page.svelte`

### Pattern Rule

- Use `let` for `$state()` variables that will be reassigned
- Use `const` for `$derived()` variables as they shouldn't be reassigned

## 2025-03-19 - Fixed Missing chatStore.ts File

### Issue

The build was failing with an error: `Could not load /Users/rickde/Documents/Code_Projects/AI_chatbot/aistrategyanalyser/src/lib/stores/chatStore (imported by src/routes/analyses/[id]/generate/+page.svelte)`

Several components were importing from '$lib/stores/chatStore', but this file didn't exist. The chat store functionality was only available in '$lib/components/chat/Chat.svelte.ts'.

### Fix

- Created a new file at 'src/lib/stores/chatStore.ts' that re-exports the necessary functionality from Chat.svelte.ts
- Implemented proper re-exporting of:
  - chatStore object
  - chatActions with createChat, addMessage, deleteChat, and switchChat methods
  - chats and currentChat reactive state

### Pattern Rule

- Store functionality should be in the /stores directory
- Components should import store functionality from the /stores directory, not directly from components

## 2025-03-19 - Fixed TypeScript Errors in Chat Components

### Issue

Several TypeScript errors were occurring in chat components:

1. Missing type declarations for $lib/types/chat
2. Improper typing of Message objects
3. Improper iteration of reactive declarations
4. Timeout type mismatch in ChatInput.svelte
5. Missing properties in object literals

### Fix

- Created proper type definitions in src/lib/types/chat.ts
- Added explicit typing for Message interface
- Created local state variables to prevent iteration errors on reactive declarations in Chat.svelte
- Fixed the Timeout type in ChatInput.svelte using NodeJS.Timeout
- Added proper HTML sanitization for markdown content
- Added missing properties to status objects

### Pattern Rule

- Define proper interfaces for all data structures
- Use explicit types for all parameters and return values
- When iterating over reactive declarations, create local state copies
- Use proper TypeScript types for Web API objects like Timeout

## 2025-03-19 - Fixed Memory Leak and Chat Loading Issues

### Issue

The application was experiencing memory leaks and unresponsiveness due to:

1. Improper handling of reactive declarations in the chat components
2. Circular references causing infinite reactivity loops
3. The `chatStore.messages` being returned as a function instead of an array
4. Issues with markdown rendering causing high CPU usage

### Fix

- Modified Chat.svelte to safely access messages through currentChat
- Updated the chatStore.ts re-export to ensure messages are always returned as an array
- Improved markdown rendering in ChatMessage.svelte to avoid errors
- Added error handling around reactive updates to prevent cascading failures
- Optimized message synchronization between store and components

### Pattern Rule

- Always use defensive copying with reactive arrays (`[...array]` instead of direct reference)
- Avoid accessing nested reactive properties directly in iteration contexts
- Add proper error handling around reactive declarations
- Be careful with circular references between reactive state objects

## 2025-03-19 - Improved Svelte 5 Reactivity with $derived.by

### Issue

The application was experiencing further reactivity issues with Svelte 5 runes:

1. Using simple `$derived` expressions caused errors when accessing derived values from outside components
2. The `chatStore.messages` derivation was causing infinite loops because it returned a function instead of array
3. No proper error handling within reactive declarations was causing cascading failures
4. The chat store didn't properly handle the case where a derived value might be a function

### Fix

- Updated derived values to use `$derived.by` which provides more control and error handling
- Added proper try/catch blocks around all reactive code
- Implemented safe accessors for reactive values that handle edge cases
- Enhanced the chatStore to handle cases where .currentChat might be a function
- Reinforced all files to use .svelte.ts extensions when using runes
- Added robust type checking with Array.isArray() and defensive programming techniques

### Pattern Rule

- Use `$derived.by(() => { ... })` instead of `$derived(expression)` for complex derivations
- Always wrap reactive code in try/catch blocks
- Check if a derived value is a function before using it (`typeof x === 'function'`)
- Use defensive programming techniques like `Array.isArray()` to validate data
- Only use runes in .svelte or .svelte.ts files
- Add logging for successful state updates to track reactivity flow

## 2025-03-19 - Fixed Build Errors

### Issue

1. Svelte state reference warnings in theme.svelte.ts:

   - `State referenced in its own scope will never update. Did you mean to reference it inside a closure?`
   - currentTheme was being referenced directly outside a reactive scope

2. JSON import error in indexingService.ts:
   - `"categoryQuestions" is not exported by "src/lib/data/category_question_prompts.json"`
   - Improper import syntax for JSON files

### Fix

1. For theme.svelte.ts:

   - Changed from using direct browser DOM manipulation to reactive $effect blocks
   - Properly isolated state references within reactive closures
   - Improved cleanup handling with return function in the effect
   - Made dark mode the consistent default theme

2. For indexingService.ts:
   - Changed the JSON import from destructured to default import
   - Created a properly typed constant for the imported data
   - Improved type safety with explicit Record typing

### Pattern Rule

1. For Svelte 5 reactivity:

   - Always use $effect() instead of direct DOM manipulation when referencing reactive state
   - Isolate DOM changes that depend on state inside reactive blocks
   - Provide cleanup functions when adding event listeners

2. For JSON imports:
   - Use default imports with JSON files: `import data from './file.json'`
   - Never use destructured imports with JSON: `import { prop } from './file.json'`
   - Add proper typing to imported JSON data

## 2025-03-19 - Fixed State Export Issue in theme.svelte.ts

### Issue

The error: "Cannot export state from a module if it is reassigned. Either export a function returning the state value or only mutate the state value's properties"

In Svelte 5, you cannot directly export reactive state variables that are reassigned within the module. The `currentTheme` variable in theme.svelte.ts was being exported directly but also reassigned in the `toggleTheme` function.

### Fix

- Changed direct state exports to function-based getter exports:
  - `currentTheme` → `getCurrentTheme()`
  - `isDark` → `getIsDark()`
  - `logoSrc` → `getLogoSrc()`
- Updated importing components to use the getter functions:
  - Fixed ThemeToggle.svelte to use `getIsDark()` instead of `theme() === 'dark'`
  - Simplified layout.svelte by removing manual theme handling
  - Updated Skeleton UI component imports to use correct paths

### Pattern Rule

- Never directly export state variables that will be reassigned
- Use getter functions to expose state that might change: `export function getState() { return state; }`
- For read-only derived values, consider using `const` with `$derived` and exporting directly
- When combining state with skeleton UI, ensure proper import paths are used

## 2025-03-19 - Fixed Chat Rendering and New Analysis Flow

### Issue

1. Chats were not rendering properly on the chats listing page
2. New analysis form was not moving correctly between screens
3. Missing proper server-side data loading for chats

### Fix

1. Fixed the chats page:

   - Changed `/chats/+page.svelte` from automatically redirecting to home to displaying all chats
   - Added proper loading of sample chats from server and user chats from localStorage
   - Added a load function in `/chats/+page.server.ts` to provide sample chats data

2. Fixed the new analysis flow:

   - Improved step navigation in `/chats/new/+page.svelte` with proper conditional logic
   - Added debug logging to track step transitions
   - Ensured validation of form fields before proceeding to next step

3. Enhanced chat store initialization:
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Improved handling of chats from multiple sources (server and localStorage)
   - Added detailed logging of chat initialization and state changes

### Pattern Rule

- Use proper load functions in +page.server.ts files to provide initial data to routes
- Implement clear step transitions in multi-step forms with explicit conditions
- Add detailed logging for reactive state changes and initialization
- Combine server data with local storage data carefully using proper error handling

## 2025-03-20 - Fixed Chat Rendering and TypeScript Errors

### Issue

1. Chats were being properly loaded from server and localStorage but not displaying on the page
2. TypeScript errors in several files:
   - Parameter 'chat' implicitly has an 'any' type in +page.svelte
   - Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string' in +page.server.ts
3. Excessive reactive updates causing multiple console logs

### Fix

1. Fixed chat rendering:

   - Added proper Chat type to allChats state variable
   - Used a temporary array to collect chats before updating state
   - Added proper type casting for sample chats data

2. Fixed TypeScript errors:

   - Added explicit type annotations for chat parameters
   - Provided default empty strings for potentially undefined form values
   - Properly imported Chat type from types file

3. Optimized reactive state handling:
   - Reduced excessive logging
   - Only updated state once with final result
   - Improved error handling for edge cases

### Pattern Rule

- Use temporary variables to collect data before updating reactive state
- Provide default values for nullable fields with the nullish coalescing operator
- Use proper type annotations for all variables, especially in reactive contexts
- Be mindful of potential infinite reactive loops when logging state variables
- In Svelte 5, use `$state.snapshot()` or `$inspect()` to log reactive state variables

## 2025-03-20 - Fixed Chat List Redirect and New Analysis Step Navigation

### Issue

1. The chat listing page at `/chats/+page.svelte` was not displaying any chats. This was caused by:

   - Improper handling of `userChatsUpdated` event listeners
   - Lack of proper initialization of the chat store
   - Missing debugging to identify where the data flow was breaking
   - Type mismatches between sample data and Chat interface
   - Inconsistent localStorage handling

### Fix

1. Updated the chat listing page:

   - Added proper debugging with console logs at key points
   - Fixed event listener handling with named function references
   - Improved conditional rendering with safer checks
   - Enhanced chat data retrieval with better error handling

2. Enhanced chat store initialization:

   - Added localStorage initialization with empty array when not present
   - Improved event dispatching for chat updates
   - Fixed user chats loading from localStorage
   - Added detailed logging of chat initialization process

3. Added chat store initialization in layout component:
   - Ensured chat store is initialized on app startup
   - Added proper type conversion for sample chats
   - Added empty messages array to sample chats to match Chat interface

### Pattern Rule

- Always use named function references for event listeners: `const handler = () => {...}; element.addEventListener('event', handler);`
- Initialize localStorage with default values when accessing potentially empty storage
- Add detailed logging around data flow to identify issues
- Ensure proper typing between server data and client interfaces
- Use defensive coding techniques like optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- Dispatch events to notify components of data changes

## 2025-03-20 - Fixed Chat Message Markdown Rendering

### Issue

The chat messages were displaying raw function outputs rather than rendering the markdown content properly:

- Functions using `$derived` for markdown parsing and timestamp formatting were showing as text
- The markup appeared as: `() => { ... }` in the UI instead of actually rendering content

### Fix

1. Replaced reactive `$derived` approach with explicit functions:

   - Created `parseMarkdown(content)` that handles both sync and async results from marked
   - Created `formatTime(timestamp)` that properly formats the timestamp
   - Added proper error handling for both functions

2. Updated the template to call these functions directly:
   - Used `{@html parseMarkdown(message.content)}` to render markdown content
   - Used `{formatTime(message.timestamp)}` to display formatted time

### Pattern Rule

- When using the marked library, handle both synchronous and asynchronous return types
- Use regular functions instead of reactive declarations for content transformations
- Make sure to use the `{@html}` tag to render HTML content from markdown
- Add proper error handling in all utility functions
- Watch out for TypeScript issues with libraries that return union types (string | Promise<string>)

## 2025-03-20 - Fixed State Export Issue in Chat.svelte.ts

### Issue

The build was failing with the error:

```
[plugin:vite-plugin-svelte-module] src/lib/components/chat/Chat.svelte.ts:343:2 Cannot export state from a module if it is reassigned. Either export a function returning the state value or only mutate the state value's properties
```

In Svelte 5, you cannot directly export state variables that are reassigned within the module. The `chats`, `currentChatId`, and other state variables in Chat.svelte.ts were being exported directly but also reassigned within the file.

### Fix

1. Changed direct state exports to function-based getter exports:

   - `chats` → `getChats()`
   - `currentChatId` → `getCurrentChatId()`
   - `status` → `getStatus()`
   - `settings` → `getSettings()`

2. Updated the main store object to use proper getters:

   - Added defensive copying to prevent mutations (`[...array]`)
   - Added proper error handling
   - Made accessors more robust

3. Updated the chatStore.ts re-export file:
   - Changed to import from new getter functions
   - Updated all references to use the new function-based exports
   - Maintained backward compatibility for existing components

### Pattern Rule

- Never directly export state variables that are reassigned in a module
- Use getter functions to expose state that might change: `export function getState() { return [...state]; }`
- Add defensive copying in getter functions to prevent unintended mutations
- Properly document the pattern for future developers
- When re-exporting state from another file, use the getter functions

## 2025-03-21: TypeScript Error Fixes and Store Separation

### Issue

Several TypeScript errors were occurring in the application:

1. Errors in archived code related to openaiClient type mismatches
2. Missing proper type for the find callback parameter in Chat.svelte
3. Missing module './Chat.svelte.ts' error in Chat.svelte

### Correction

1. **Fixed openaiClient Mock Implementation in Archived Code**

   - Updated the mock implementation to match expected types
   - Added proper return types for generateStreamingResponse and checkHealth methods
   - Added stream.getReader implementation to prevent 'getReader not found on type never' error

2. **Fixed Chat Component TypeScript Issues**

   - Added proper type annotation for the callback parameter in find method: `(c: Chat) => c.id === chatId`
   - Updated import to use the store from `$lib/stores/chatStore.svelte` instead of local file

3. **Created Proper Store File with Svelte 5 Runes**
   - Created a dedicated store file at `src/lib/stores/chatStore.svelte.ts`
   - Implemented the store with proper type definitions
   - Used Svelte 5 runes for state management ($state, $derived.by)
   - Maintained singleton pattern for store initialization

### Impact

- Eliminated TypeScript errors throughout the codebase
- Improved code organization with proper separation of concerns
- Maintained reactivity with Svelte 5 runes
- Better type safety and autocompletion in component code

## 2025-03-21: Settings Page Enhancements

### Issue

TypeScript errors in the settings page where the settings object in chatStore didn't include the properties `webSearch` and `webSearchContextSize` that were being accessed.

### Correction

1. **Enhanced Settings Model**

   - Added `webSearch` and `webSearchContextSize` properties to the chatState.settings object
   - Updated the ChatStoreInterface definition to include these new properties
   - Added proper type definitions to ensure type safety

2. **Added Dedicated Settings Methods**

   - Created `updateWebSearch` method to toggle web search functionality
   - Created `updateWebSearchContextSize` method to change context size
   - Created `saveSettingsToLocalStorage` helper method for reuse
   - Updated the init function to load all settings from localStorage

3. **Improved Settings Page Event Handling**
   - Replaced Svelte bindings with explicit event handlers
   - Added proper event handling functions with type assertions
   - Improved reactivity by using the store's methods directly

### Impact

- Eliminated TypeScript errors in the settings page
- Improved code organization with dedicated methods for each setting type
- Enhanced persistence with better localStorage management
- Added better type safety across settings-related code

## Svelte 5 Runes Export Fix (2024-03-25)

### Implemented Changes

1. **Fixed Derived State Export**

   - Modified ChatsStore.svelte.ts to use accessor functions instead of directly exporting derived state
   - Implemented proper state synchronization in ChatStore.svelte
   - Added $effect to keep local state updated with the store's state

2. **Improved Component Pattern**
   - Enhanced the store pattern to be more compatible with Svelte 5 module scripts
   - Created a clean separation between internal reactive state and exposed API
   - Added proper synchronization between local and store state

### Current Status

- Resolved the "Cannot export derived state from a module" error
- Improved reactivity with consistent state updates
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

### Technical Details

When working with Svelte 5 runes in modules, you cannot directly export derived state. Instead:

1. Export accessor functions that return the current value of the state:

   ```ts
   // Instead of: export const value = $derived(...)
   export function getValue() {
     return value;
   }
   ```

2. In consuming components, create local state and use $effect to keep it updated:
   ```ts
   let localValue = $state(storeModule.getValue());
   $effect(() => {
     localValue = storeModule.getValue();
   });
   ```

This pattern ensures proper reactivity while following Svelte 5's module constraints.

     const lines = buffer.split("\n");
     buffer = lines.pop() || "";

     // Process each complete SSE message
     for (const line of lines) {
       if (line.trim()) {
         processLine(line);
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Content Extraction**

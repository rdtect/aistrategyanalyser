### File Organization Improvements

1. **Create Barrel Files for Organization**

   ```typescript
   // lib/components/index.ts
   export * from "./Button";
   export * from "./Input";
   export * from "./chat/Chat";
   ```

2. **Standardize File Naming Conventions**

   - Use consistent casing (preferably PascalCase for components, camelCase for utilities)
   - Use consistent extensions (.svelte for UI, .svelte.ts for logic with runes)

3. **Organize by Feature, Not Type**
   - Current: Organized by type (components, stores, services)
   - Consider: Feature-based organization for large features
     ```
     features/
     ├── chat/
     │   ├── components/
     │   ├── stores/
     │   └── services/
     ├── analysis/
     │   ├── components/
     │   └── stores/
     ```
